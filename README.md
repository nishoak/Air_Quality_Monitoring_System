# Air_Quality_Monitoring_System
In todayâ€™s world, Air pollution has become curse to humankind and in fact it is a matter of
concern which must be addressed very soon. Therefore, for continuous monitoring of Air
quality levels, An IoT based Smart Air Quality monitoring system is developed and has been
brought forward for the above purpose. The major drawback of the proposed framework is
the need for repeated calibration of MQ sensors.
The frame work for the Air Quality Monitoring system consists of MQ Gas sensors and a
PM10 sensor and Arduino UNO which is connected to the Internet via an ESP8266 Module
and using the ESP8266 Module, sensor data is sent to Thing speak Cloud Platform .The
sensor raw data is converted to the necessary Parts Per Million (PPM) data format to
implement the concept of Edge Computing. Therefore, levels of hazardous gases such as
Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Ammonia can be detected and if required, necessary
actions can be initiated to reduce the pollution. Further, using the concentration values of
above gases, Air Quality Index (AQI) is calculated. The IoT framework can be utilized for
observing the Air Pollution of certain localities and help in rectifying the existing problems of
Air Pollution in such areas.
